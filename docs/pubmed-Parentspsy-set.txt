AB  - Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are neurodevelopmental disorders in which 
      multiple genetic and environmental factors play roles. Symptoms of deficits in 
      social communication and restrictive, repetitive behavioral patterns emerge early 
      in a child's development. While parents do not cause these difficulties, 
      impairments in social relatedness can strain parent child interactions and 
      parental stress can have negative transactional effects that impede children 
      development. Conversely, as with typically developing children, parental behavior 
      can also enhance development in ASD and parents play a role in many 
      interventions. In this review we examine parental contributions to the 
      development of children with ASD, focusing on social communication and emotion 
      regulation. We address parent and family characteristics that may impede 
      development so they can be identified in families and interventions developed to 
      target them.

TI  - Parenting interventions to promote early child development in the first three 
      years of life: A global systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - e1003602

LID - e1003602
AB  - BACKGROUND: Parents are the primary caregivers of young children. Responsive 
      parent-child relationships and parental support for learning during the earliest 
      years of life are crucial for promoting early child development (ECD). We 
      conducted a global systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of parenting interventions on ECD and parenting outcomes. METHODS 
      AND FINDINGS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and 
      Global Health Library for peer-reviewed, published articles from database 
      inception until November 15, 2020. We included randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of parenting interventions delivered during the first 3 years of life that 
      evaluated at least 1 ECD outcome. At least 2 reviewers independently screened, 
      extracted data, and assessed study quality from eligible studies. ECD outcomes 
      included cognitive, language, motor, and socioemotional development, behavior 
      problems, and attachment. Parenting outcomes included parenting knowledge, 
      parenting practices, parent-child interactions, and parental depressive symptoms. 
      We calculated intervention effect sizes as the standardized mean difference (SMD) 
      and estimated pooled effect sizes for each outcome separately using robust 
      variance estimation meta-analytic approaches. We used random-effects 
      meta-regression models to assess potential effect modification by country-income 
      level, child age, intervention content, duration, delivery, setting, and study 
      quality. This review was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42018092458 and 
      CRD42018092461). Of the 11,920 articles identified, we included 111 articles 
      representing 102 unique RCTs. Pooled effect sizes indicated positive benefits of 
      parenting interventions on child cognitive development (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI 
      [confidence interval]: 0.23, 0.40, P < 0.001), language development (SMD = 0.28, 
      95% CI: 0.18 to 0.37, P < 0.001), motor development (SMD = 0.24, 95% CI: 0.15 to 
      0.32, P < 0.001), socioemotional development (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.28, P 
      < 0.001), and attachment (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.40, P < 0.001) and 
      reductions in behavior problems (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.08, P < 0.001). 
      Positive benefits were also found on parenting knowledge (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI: 
      0.33 to 0.79, P < 0.001), parenting practices (SMD = 0.33, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.44, 
      P < 0.001), and parent-child interactions (SMD = 0.39, 95% CI: 0.24 to 0.53, P < 
      0.001). However, there was no significant reduction in parental depressive 
      symptoms (SMD = -0.07, 95% CI: -0.16 to 0.02, P = 0.08). Subgroup analyses 
      revealed significantly greater effects on child cognitive, language, and motor 
      development, and parenting practices in low- and middle-income countries compared 
      to high-income countries; and significantly greater effects on child cognitive 
      development, parenting knowledge, parenting practices, and parent-child 
      interactions for programs that focused on responsive caregiving compared to those 
      that did not. On the other hand, there was no clear evidence of effect 
      modification by child age, intervention duration, delivery, setting, or study 
      risk of bias. Study limitations include considerable unexplained heterogeneity, 
      inadequate reporting of intervention content and implementation, and varying 
      quality of evidence in terms of the conduct of trials and robustness of outcome 
      measures used across studies. CONCLUSIONS: Parenting interventions for children 
      during the first 3 years of life are effective for improving ECD outcomes and 
      enhancing parenting outcomes across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. 
      Increasing implementation of effective and high-quality parenting interventions 
      is needed globally and at scale in order to support parents and enable young 
      children to achieve their full developmental potential.

TI  - Affect, Body, and Eating Habits in Children: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/nu15153343 [doi]
LID - 3343
AB  - The present review investigates the complex associations between children's 
      affective states, body perceptions, and eating habits, thus providing crucial 
      insights for potential health interventions. Following PRISMA guidelines, three 
      databases were searched for peer-reviewed studies exploring the relationship 
      between eating habits, emotional states, and body image perceptions in a 
      population of children (5 to 11 years old). A total of seven articles were 
      included. Our findings revealed a pattern of associations between negative 
      emotional states, like anxiety and depressive feelings, and maladaptive eating 
      behaviors. Additionally, explicit influences from parental feeding practices, 
      peer pressure, socioeconomic factors, and children's body perceptions were 
      observed to shape eating habits, with a pronounced tendency among older girls 
      towards dieting and food preoccupation. Our results underline the intertwining 
      nature of age, gender, and emotional states. Furthermore, our findings accentuate 
      the urgency for comprehensive interventions that acknowledge and address the 
      complex interplay of emotional, familial, and socioeconomic factors alongside 
      children's body image perceptions. The criticality of continued research, 
      particularly ones employing longitudinal designs and diverse demographic samples, 
      is highlighted as we strive to understand and navigate such multifaceted 
      relationships to enhance children's health and well-being.

TI  - The effects of a music and singing intervention during pregnancy on maternal 
      well-being and mother-infant bonding: a randomised, controlled study.
PG  - 69-83
LID - 10.1007/s00404-020-05727-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Stress and impaired mother-infant bonding during pregnancy can lead to 
      adverse effects for the expectant mother and the unborn child. The present study 
      investigates whether a prenatal music and singing intervention can improve 
      maternal well-being as well as mother-infant bonding. METHODS: A total of 172 
      pregnant women took part in this prospective, randomised, three-armed (music, 
      singing or control group) study. Depressive symptoms, self-efficacy, maternal 
      well-being and mother-infant bonding were assessed with visual analogue scales 
      and questionnaires before the intervention phase (30th week of gestation) and 
      afterwards (36th week of gestation). Additionally, immediate changes regarding 
      experienced stress and mood from before until after the music and singing 
      interventions were explored with questionnaires as well as saliva samples (for 
      cortisol, alpha-amylase and oxytocin determination). RESULTS: Regarding immediate 
      effects, both interventions showed positive effects on the emotional state, 
      stress (cortisol) and bonding (oxytocin). Additionally, the singing group showed 
      a larger reduction in cortisol and a larger improvement in valence than the music 
      group. Looking at more prolonged effects, significant effects on general 
      self-efficacy and perceived closeness to the unborn child (measured with a visual 
      analogue scale) were found. No significant effects were revealed for the 
      mother-infant bonding questionnaire and for depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: In 
      the present study, promising effects of music and in particular singing on 
      maternal well-being and perceived closeness during pregnancy appeared. Prenatal 
      music and singing interventions could be an easy to implement and effective 
      addition to improve mood and well-being of the expectant mother and support 
      mother-infant bonding. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: DRKS00012822, date of

TI  - Parental Stress and Well-Being: A Meta-analysis.
PG  - 255-274
LID - 10.1007/s10567-025-00515-9 [doi]
AB  - The current meta-analysis aims to investigate the relationship between parental 
      stress and well-being, by focusing on the positive dimensions of parental 
      well-being, such as happiness and life satisfaction, which are often overlooked 
      in favor of negative outcomes like depression. It also extends the scope beyond 
      specific populations, such as parents of children with special needs, to include 
      parents of typically developing children. This meta-analysis included evidence 
      from cross-sectional, longitudinal, daily diary, and intervention studies. By 
      examining various moderators related to parent and child variables (such as 
      gender, age, job status) and study characteristics, this analysis aims to inform 
      more effective, targeted interventions to enhance parental well-being. Systematic 
      searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, APA PsychNet, Scopus, ProQuest, and 
      Google Scholar databases yielded 86 studies, involving 22,108 parents of children 
      aged 0 to 18 years. The PROSPERO registration number for this study is 
      CRD42023428750. Elected outcomes were continuous self-report measures to assess 
      stress and well-being of parents. Our findings indicated a significant negative 
      medium-sized association between parental stress and well-being (r = - .40), 
      i.e., greater parental stress was robustly linked to reduced well-being. 
      Higher-quality studies reported stronger stress-well-being associations, 
      underscoring the role of methodological rigor in producing reliable estimates. 
      Additionally, studies utilizing the Parental Stress Index (PSI) demonstrated 
      stronger associations, highlighting its utility as a validated measure for 
      capturing parental stress. Overall, these findings emphasize the need for 
      evidence-based prevention and intervention programs to address parental stress 
      and improve well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 has changed 
      American society in ways that are difficult to capture in a timely manner. With 
      this study, we take advantage of daily survey data collected before and after the 
      crisis started to investigate the hypothesis that the crisis has worsened 
      parents' and children's psychological well-being. We also examine the extent of 
      crisis-related hardships and evaluate the hypothesis that the accumulation of 
      hardships will be associated with parent and child psychological well-being. 
      METHODS: Daily survey data were collected between February 20 and April 27, 2020, 
      from hourly service workers with a young child (aged 2-7) in a large US city (N = 
      8222 person-days from 645 individuals). A subsample completed a one-time survey 
      about the effects of the crisis fielded between March 23 and April 26 (subsample 
      n = 561). RESULTS: Ordered probit models revealed that the frequency of 
      parent-reported daily negative mood increased significantly since the start of 
      the crisis. Many families have experienced hardships during the crisis, including 
      job loss, income loss, caregiving burden, and illness. Both parents' and 
      children's well-being in the postcrisis period was strongly associated with the 
      number of crisis-related hardships that the family experienced. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Consistent with our hypotheses, in families that have experienced multiple 
      hardships related to the coronavirus disease 2019 crisis, both parents' and 
      children's mental health is worse. As the crisis continues to unfold, 
      pediatricians should screen for mental health, with particular attention to 
      children whose families are especially vulnerable to economic and disease aspects 
      of the crisis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cancer treatment can have profound effects on the growth and 
      development of pediatric patients. Different models of psychosocial development 
      and behavioral treatment approaches aid children receiving medical treatment. 
      Providing education, anticipatory guidance, and individualized support to child 
      and their families is a psychosocial standard. OBJECTIVE: Clarify the different 
      models of psychosocial development and applicable psychosocial interventions to 
      better prepare and tailor cancer treatment to pediatric patients. METHODS: 
      Authors reviewed existing evidenced-based literature in oncology, psychology, 
      developmental, and psychiatric while drawing on case examples and expert 
      knowledge to illustrate the impact of cancer treatment on pediatric patients, 
      analyze developmentally individualized needs, and describe facilitative 
      interventions. RESULT: Pediatric patients of all ages cope and adjust better to 
      all phases of treatment when their care is delivered in a 
      developmentally-informed and psychosocially thoughtful way. CONCLUSION: Providers 
      can comprehensively prepare their patients and families for treatment better by 
      utilizing a psychosocially- and developmentally-informed framework while meeting 
      individualized unique needs of patients. An integrated multidisciplinary 
      psychosocial support team is facilitative in anticipating and meeting the needs 
      of pediatric cancer patients and has recently become a psychosocial standard of 
      care.

LID - 10.1093/jpepsy/jsz019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine trajectories of psychological distress in mothers of 
      children born very preterm (VPT, <30 weeks gestation) and full term from 2 to 
      13 years after the birth, and examine predictors of maternal psychological 
      distress over time within the VPT group. METHODS: Mothers of children born VPT 
      (n = 159) and full term (n = 71) completed questionnaires assessing their 
      psychological distress when their child was 2, 7, and 13 years of age. Mixed 
      models were used to examine differences between groups in maternal psychological 
      distress over time. Family social risk, child neonatal medial risk, child sex, 
      multiple pregnancy, and child's neurodevelopmental impairment in early childhood 
      were examined as potential predictors of maternal psychological distress within 
      the VPT group. RESULTS: Mothers of children born VPT displayed elevated 
      psychological distress compared with mothers of full-term children, and this 
      difference was consistent over time. Higher family social risk was associated 
      with elevated maternal psychological distress throughout childhood across all 
      time-points. There was evidence that mothers of children at higher neonatal 
      medical risk displayed increasing psychological distress over time. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Mothers of children born VPT show prolonged psychological distress. Mothers from 
      socially disadvantaged background and those whose child has neonatal medical 
      complications may require extensive support to prevent prolonged psychological 
      distress and promote optimal outcomes for children and families.

LID - e300971
AB  - QUESTION: For parents of children and young people (CYP) with diagnosed mental 
      health difficulties, what are the levels of parents' well-being and psychological 
      need? STUDY SELECTION AND ANALYSIS: Medline, PsycINFO, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL, Web 
      of Science and Cochrane Library of Registered Trials were searched from inception 
      to June 2023. INCLUSION CRITERIA: parents of CYP aged 5-18 years with formal 
      mental health diagnosis. Data were extracted from validated measures of 
      well-being or psychological needs with established cut-off points or from a 
      controlled study. FINDINGS: 32 of the 73 310 records screened were included. 
      Pooled means showed clinical range scores for one measure of depression, and all 
      included measures of anxiety, parenting stress and general stress. Meta-analyses 
      showed greater depression (g=0.24, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.38) and parenting stress 
      (g=0.34, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.49) in parents of CYP with mental health difficulties 
      versus those without. Mothers reported greater depression (g=0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 
      0.66) and anxiety (g=0.73, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.18) than fathers. Narrative synthesis 
      found no clear patterns in relation to CYP condition. Rates of parents with 
      clinically relevant levels of distress varied. Typically, anxiety, parenting 
      stress and general stress scored above clinical threshold. Quality appraisal 
      revealed few studies with a clearly defined control group, or attempts to control 
      for important variables such as parent gender. CONCLUSIONS: The somewhat mixed 
      results suggest clinical anxiety, parenting and general stress may be common, 
      with sometimes high depression. Assessment and support for parents of CYP with 
      mental health problems is required. Further controlled studies, with 
      consideration of pre-existing parental mental health difficulties are required.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the efficacy of psychological interventions delivered to 
      mothers of young children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in improving 
      maternal mental health and the parent-child relationship. METHOD: Electronic 
      databases were searched from inception to December 2021. Studies were included if 
      they were randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of psychological interventions that 
      targeted maternal mental health (primary outcome) and/or the parent-child 
      relationship (secondary outcome), delivered to mothers of children (mean 
      age < 60 months) with ASD. Meta-analyses of three parent mental health outcomes 
      (stress, depressive symptomatology, and general mental health) and seven 
      parent-child relationship outcomes (parent responsiveness, affect, directiveness, 
      non-directiveness, child initiation, infant positive affect, and infant 
      attentiveness) were conducted using both mean and standardized mean differences. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-two RCTs met the inclusion criteria (2336 participants). Six RCTs 
      showed improved maternal mental health (Cohen's d = 0.41-1.15), with moderate 
      certainty of evidence for improvement in parental stress. There was low and high 
      certainty of evidence of treatment effect on parental depressive symptoms and 
      general mental health respectively, which did not show significant treatment 
      effects post-intervention. Seventeen RCTs showed improved parent-child 
      relationship (d = 0.33-2.28; low certainty of evidence). INTERPRETATION: Results 
      demonstrated that parenting interventions promoting responsiveness had the 
      largest positive effect on the parent-child relationship and a moderate effect on 
      overall parenting stress; however, the studies were heterogeneous, making it 
      difficult to identify the intervention components that were responsible for the 
      positive treatment effects. There was no significant treatment effect for studies 
      targeting depression or general mental health, likely due to the lack of an 
      interventional component directly targeting mental health.
