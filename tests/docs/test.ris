AB  - Introduction: Patients with complex Chronic Overlapping Pain Conditions (COPCs) experience a high disease burden and a strong negative impact on their quality of life. Current care is fragmented and shows limited effectiveness. To improve care for these patients, an integrated, interdisciplinary care pathway was developed, implemented and evaluated. The aim of this study is to describe this process, including the outcomes on feasibility and perceived value. Methods: A mixed-methods design, combining qualitative and quantitative methods, was used. To develop the pathway, an iterative process with all stakeholders was organized. The implementation was guided by the Grol and Wensing framework. For the evaluation of the feasibility, data on patient and healthcare professional (HCP) adherence was collected. To evaluate the perceived value, semi-structured interviews were conducted. Results: The development and implementation resulted in an integrated care pathway that supports patients and HCPs in making shared decisions about their therapy goals and treatment plan. A total of 105 patients were included in the pathway of whom 83 (79%) completed it. Patient adherence to therapy sessions was high (mean 84%). Fifty-eight HCPs were trained and used the pathway. Both patients and HCPs were positive about the content and structure of the pathway, and the interdisciplinary collaboration. Discussion: The development and implementation of an integrated, interdisciplinary care pathway for patients with complex COPCs proved to be feasible and valuable for both patients and HCPs. Future research should focus on the (cost)effectiveness of this pathway in a multicenter study.
